# Sequential-Forward-Selection-Algorithm

Input: a dataset where the last column is the class variable.
Output: a set of important features

The program will load the dataset, and then use wrapper approach with sequential forward selection strategy to find a set of important features.

•	Used stratified 5-fold cross validation for measuring accuracy.
•	program will keep adding the features as long as there is some improvement in the classification accuracy.
•	Output of the program will be the set of important features on the console
